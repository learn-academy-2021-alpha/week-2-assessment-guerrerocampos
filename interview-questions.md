  import React { component } from 'react'
  <!-- not sure what the question was asking  if its for what you need in the class
  constructor() {
    super ()
  }
  render() {
    return() {

    }
  } -->

  Researched answer: const Greeting = () => <h1>Hello World today!</h1>;
  <!-- i understand this, but again i think i just misunderstood the question(one of the advantages of doing it in person is i could've asked for clarification for the question) -->

    }
  }
